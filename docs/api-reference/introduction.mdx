## Overview

InternTA provides a chat completions API that allows you to integrate our synthetic biology teaching assistant capabilities into your applications. The API follows a similar style to other popular chat completion APIs, making it familiar for developers.

<Note>
  InternTA is specifically trained on synthetic biology content and is optimized for educational interactions in this domain.
</Note>

## Base URL

```bash
https://api.ecopi.chat/v1
```

## Authentication

All API requests require authentication using Bearer tokens.

```bash
