## Development Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kongfoo-ai/internTA
cd internTA
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Model Development

### Data Generation

The first step in customizing InternTA is preparing the training data. We support two types of fine-tuning data:
- Direct Q&A data
- Guided Q&A data

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="database" title="Data Preparation Process">
    1. Compile a question bank including:
      - Post-class thought questions
      - Key terms from the appendix
      - Fundamental concept knowledge
    
    2. Search for corresponding answers in the textbook
    
    3. Organize answers into a response database:
      - Direct answers for key terms
      - Guided responses for thought questions
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="code" title="Generate Training Data">
    ```bash
    # Navigate to data directory
    cd data
    
    # Run data generation script
    python generate_data.py
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Model Fine-tuning

<Steps>
  <Step title="Verify Training Data">
    Check for the presence of training data:
    ```bash
    ls -lh data/personal_assistant.json
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start Fine-tuning">
    Run the training script:
    ```bash
    sh train.sh
    ```
    This will use fine-tune the base DeepSeek model.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check Training Progress">
    Monitor the training directory:
    ```bash
    ls -lh train
    ```
    Look for weight directories named `pth_$NUM_EPOCH`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Merge Model Weights">
    ```bash
    # Replace $NUM_EPOCH with your target epoch number
    sh merge.sh $NUM_EPOCH
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Testing and Evaluation

### Interactive Testing

Test your model changes using the chat interface:

```bash
sh chat.sh
```

### Automated Evaluation

Run the evaluation suite to measure model performance:

```bash
pytest ./test/test_model_evaluation.py
```

This will:
1. Generate responses for test cases
2. Calculate ROUGE similarity scores
3. Output results to `test_results.csv`


## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="memory" title="GPU Memory Issues">
    If you encounter GPU memory errors:
    1. Reduce batch size in training configuration
    2. Use gradient checkpointing
    3. Ensure no other processes are using GPU memory
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion icon="database" title="Data Generation Issues">
    If data generation fails:
    1. Check input file formats
    2. Verify textbook content is properly formatted
    3. Ensure sufficient disk space
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
